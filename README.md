# PhUnwr_CNN

Here are my control center scripts from which I conduct model fittings in a phase unwrapping task.
Normally I use UNet structures with residual blocks, but my journey to find a working solution might take me elsewhere completely.

I am very new to GitHub so if it looks messy, it will for now. Reach me if you have suggestions or comments about my code, models or learning parameters.
Enjoy.
